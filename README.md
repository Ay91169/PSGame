# how to add XA
to anyone who stumbled upon this game. and you dont know how to add XA. here is a little guide

- Get [MOVCONV32](https://www.psxdev.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=957) (thanks to shadow and psx.dev community)
- Get a functioing WAV
- Convert it to XA in "convert" in MOVCONV32
- then add it to a multichannel, tick subheader and extract the output.
- voil√†! its a functioning XA (you can add more audios to one file and play them. by channel. its a good way to use the ps1 efficiently)
